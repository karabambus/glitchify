# GlitchOpenCV v1.0.0

This program allows the user to create glitch art by applying audio effects (delay, echo, phaser, and bass boost) to an input image.

## Requirements
- OpenCV 3.2 or higher
- libsndfile 1.0.28 or higher

## Usage
To run the program, compile and execute the source code using a C++ compiler. The input image and audio data are hard-coded in the source code and cannot be changed without modifying the code.

## Limitations
In this version, the program does not allow the user to specify the values of the audio effect parameters (e.g. delay time, feedback, etc.). These values are hard-coded in the source code and cannot be changed without modifying the code. In future versions, it is planned to add support for user-specified parameter values.
